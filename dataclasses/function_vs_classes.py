# Functions take input arguments, then do something, and they return a result.
# Or you can take that result and pas it to other functions.
# Use functions when your code is action focused and use classes when your code is state focused.

# What's nice about Python it's we have a huge flexibility, try to use a careful combination of both!

# Basically, if the programme that you're writing is more focused with the flow , like processing data in sequence,
# Then using a more functional approach is going to be better, and it's also going to make it easier to write tests.
# If it's really more focused on state, like the bank accounts example, or you have collections of objects that need to be structured in some way,
# And you have a few methods that modify those objects that with the class based approach will typically be better.
# USE DATACLASS IF YOU ARE DOING CLASSES
